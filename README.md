# -Nimbus_-Secure-Authentication-System-KRISHNA-GOPAL-RATHORE-RITESH-VISHWAKARMA-
A C-based authentication simulator that lets users register and log in securely. Passwords are encrypted before storage, and login compares encrypted inputs. Repeated failed attempts trigger an intrusion alert. The project applies cybersecurity, cryptography, authentication, access control, and CIA Triad concepts.
